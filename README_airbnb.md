# About Dataset:
Airbnb is an American company that operates an online marketplace primarily for vacation home rentals, accommodation, and tourism activities.

Headquartered in San Francisco, California, the platform can be accessed through its website and mobile application. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it generates profit by taking a commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com.

Since 2008, guests and hosts have been using Airbnb to travel in a more unique and personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activities of bed and breakfasts in New York City.
